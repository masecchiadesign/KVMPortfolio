    The reason why I am applying into Design is simple: without creativity, I am not happy.
    In order for me to feel fulfilled, I need to know that I’m either creating or contributing to a creative atmosphere.
    When I was 17, I was in the Fine Arts program at John Abbott College.
    It taught me a lot about the different creative fields and the importance of sustainability.
    The 5 classes that really shaped me as an artist were graphic design, painting, drawing, print making and sculpture.
    Prior to going into the program, I was always enrolled in some sort of art class whether it was in school or out of school activities.

    In 2016, I was hired as a Marketing Coordinator for a company called Aquabrass.
    This position is very hands on, design driven and very much focused on sustainability.
    Aquabrass is an innovator in the bath and kitchen industry. Their expertise and craftsmanship is what sets them apart from all other competitors.
    Aquabrass focuses on the flair that they add to functionality, and the constant movement within the interior design world. Our goal as a brand is to demonstrate our passion for design through our creations, many of them made to measure.
    As a marketing coordinator, I work alongside a graphic artist, where we create brochures, sample casing, etc. I was very much inspired by her job, and the creative freedom along side it.
    As I participated in product photoshoots, marketing tactics, web design, social media and collaborations, the interior design world enhanced my passion for creating and allowed me to gain inspiration.

    Going back to my studies at John Abbott, I found myself confused with what field I wanted to go into after graduating. I knew I wanted to pursue something in the design field, but I was very much conflicted by society and what the majority of my friends were doing. Being the only person in my group of friends who did not have a passion to pursue a career in business, was something that took some time for me to digest. After doing some soul searching, and allowing myself to become inspired by my work experiences, meeting designers, attending design trade shows and travelling, a lightbulb went off and I finally allowed myself to dive in.
  </p>

  <p class="text-white">
    Throughout the past year, I’ve been working on my own projects, and learning new programs that have helped me find the right path for me. My goal is to pursue a career as a graphic artist and take part in art directing. My dream job is to work for Sid Lee, a company that has inspired me very much, and has motivated me to work as hard as I can to get where I want to be. Throughout the years, I’ve learnt how to use several software programs such as, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I have also taught myself how to build a website from scratch using HTML, CSS and a little bit JavaScript/Jquery. When I was a young girl, I was introduced to Photography, as my father owned his own studio. I developed a passion for black and white photography, and have taken that inspiration and put it towards projects at work. With all the knowledge I have gained throughout my work exprience, life experiences, schooling and creative programs, I know I would be a student who would flourish within Concordia’s design program, and make my dreams come true. The Design program has a lot to offer in terms of group projects, leadership, studying the importance of sustainability and understanding that with Design, you are not only creating something, but you are also creating an experience. Some of my greatest strengths are that I work extremely well in a group settings, and I’m not afraid of criticsm, or sharing personal feedback. I have no fear when it comes to leadership, and I take my time to learn and grasp new concepts. I am a very hands on person, and I appreciate learning new things, even if it means stepping out of my comfort zone. I whole heartedly promise, that given the opportunity to enter into Concordia's Design program, I will consistently drive for creative wonders and uplift those around me into doing the same.
